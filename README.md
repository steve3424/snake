## snake

This is a snake game for the linux terminal. Most of the code is not mine.

I found a question posted by sergayrar [here](codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/132604/snake-game-in-c-for-linux-console) about issues he was having with his snake game. I tried to run his code but was having some problems. I fixed the issues I think and also change some of the code structure and formatting. I have included the original code by sergayrar.
